00:00
so you're in high school physics class
00:02
and your teacher asks the class
00:04
okay everyone what is the formula for
00:07
momentum
00:08
and you being an eager young physics
00:10
student raise your hand
00:11
and proudly tell your teacher that
00:13
momentum equals mass
00:14
times velocity and your teacher says
00:17
great job
00:18
that is exactly right momentum equals
00:20
mass times velocity
00:21
and the whole class claps and cheers for
00:23
you because you got the answer right
00:25
and you go up to the front of the class
00:27
and your teacher gives you a gold star
00:29
for being such a good physics student
00:31
and that night you go home
00:33
and your parents are there and they say
00:35
we hear you got an answer right
00:36
in physics class today and so we decided
00:38
to celebrate your birthday
00:40
six months early and then they give you
00:42
an xbox
00:43
and so you stand proudly with your xbox
00:45
in one hand
00:46
and a copy of a brief history of time by
00:48
stephen hawking in the other
00:50
and you tell yourself that this is the
00:51
best day of your life
00:53
so you graduate high school with amazing
00:55
grades and then the day finally comes
00:57
when you go to university to study
00:59
physics
01:00
and you're really excited because you
01:01
are going to become a scientist
01:03
you show up to your mechanics class and
01:05
the professor asks
01:06
what is the formula for momentum and you
01:09
tell your professor momentum equals mass
01:11
times velocity
01:12
and then your professor gives you an
01:14
angry look and she says
01:15
you complete idiot this isn't some
01:17
physics class for dumb babies
01:19
we are studying rotational mechanics and
01:21
in rotational mechanics an object's
01:23
momentum is defined using the inertia
01:25
tensor
01:25
which is a symmetric 3x3 matrix that you
01:27
can calculate by doing integrals over
01:29
the mass distribution
01:31
and the whole class of 300 people laugh
01:33
at you for getting the answer wrong
01:35
and for being a dumb idiot and you ask
01:37
yourself if you are really meant to be a
01:39
physics student after
01:40
all maybe you are too much of a dumb
01:42
idiot to study physics
01:43
you go home that night and desperately
01:45
search the internet to figure out what
01:47
the inertia tensor is
01:48
but you just get lost in a maze of
01:50
wikipedia articles and feel more
01:51
confused than when you started you
01:54
remember that day when your high school
01:55
teacher told you that you were right for
01:57
saying that momentum
01:58
equals mass times velocity and you
02:00
wonder why your high school physics
02:01
teacher lied to you
02:02
and why they didn't tell you about the
02:04
inertia tensor the next day you show up
02:06
at your relativity class
02:08
and your professor is albert einstein
02:10
and einstein tells you that momentum is
02:12
a four-dimensional vector that lives in
02:14
four-dimensional space-time
02:15
and you tell einstein that you thought
02:17
momentum was calculated with the
02:18
three-by-three symmetric inertia tensor
02:21
and einstein is like well technically
02:23
rotational angular momentum is a
02:25
four-dimensional bivector but that's
02:27
outside the scope of this course
02:29
later you go to your advanced mechanics
02:31
class and your professor tells you that
02:32
generalized momentum
02:34
conjugate to position is defined as the
02:36
partial derivative of the lagrangian
02:38
with respect to q
02:39
dot and in hamiltonian mechanics
02:41
momentum is just a coordinate in the
02:42
phase space
02:43
on a symplectic manifold and then you go
02:45
to your quantum physics class and the
02:47
professor says that momentum
02:48
measurements are always probabilistic
02:50
and the way to get the expected value of
02:52
momentum is to operate on the
02:53
wavefunction with the momentum operator
02:55
which has the square root of negative 1
02:57
in it for some reason
02:58
and then do an integral over all
03:00
possible outcomes and also the momentum
03:02
wave function might be the fourier
03:04
transform of the position wave function
03:05
but he can't be sure since everything is
03:07
just probabilities
03:09
at this point you've completely given up
03:10
trying to understand what momentum is
03:12
you've stopped going to classes and
03:14
you've stopped doing your homework
03:15
because life is pointless and physics
03:17
will never
03:18
make sense no matter how hard you try
03:20
you remember back to the greatest day of
03:22
your life when your high school physics
03:23
teacher gave you a gold star
03:25
and you remember now that your teacher
03:27
had this tired look in her eye
03:29
a quiet sadness that you couldn't
03:31
explain and that's when you realize
03:33
she knew she knew that momentum wasn't
03:35
equal to mass times velocity
03:37
because she had gone to university to
03:38
study physics just like you
03:40
and she lied to you to protect you from
03:42
the truth
03:43
because she didn't want you to deal with
03:45
the pain of never knowing what momentum
03:46
is because it's too complicated
03:48
and you realize that students all over
03:50
the world are in high school right now
03:52
being lied to being told that momentum
03:54
is mass times velocity
03:56
and they too will go to university and
03:58
learn the truth and suffer just like you
04:00
did
04:00
and you clench your fists in anger you
04:03
realize that the eternal cycle of folly
04:05
needs to be stopped and it's time to
04:06
destroy momentum once and for all
04:09
so you go to switzerland and dig a
04:11
tunnel to the large hadron collider
04:13
and you're about to push the secret
04:14
button on the large hadron collider that
04:16
will destroy the universe
04:18
but then the avengers show up to stop
04:19
you and captain america tells you that
04:22
he understands how you feel
04:23
and that we've all been there we've all
04:25
been confused in physics class
04:27
and think that we're dumb but the way to
04:29
deal with pain isn't to destroy the
04:31
universe
04:31
instead we should help others and use
04:33
our life experience to make the world
04:35
less painful
04:36
for future generations and iron man says
04:38
he wants
04:39
shawarma anyway the avengers beat you up
04:41
and the police arrest you and when
04:43
you're in court the judge sentences you
04:45
to life in prison for trying to destroy
04:47
the universe which is the worst possible
04:49
crime
04:49
so you're sentenced to life in a
04:51
frictionless vacuum
04:52
eternally bouncing off the walls of your
04:54
cell in perfectly elastic collisions
04:57
and all you can think about is whether
04:58
you should calculate your momentum with
05:00
an inertia tensor or a lagrangian or a
05:02
wave function
05:03
and you will never know the answer
05:11
happy April fools normally i use this
05:14
channel to teach math and physics
05:16
