Python Question
What method would you pick to solve this problem?
First, pick the method, then provide solution.ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”

>>> heights_inches = [ 71,  75,  68,  72,  73]
>>> weight_pounds  = [165, 190, 140, 175, 185]

What is the average weight of the persons with height above 71 inches?
How are you solving this problem?
- (A) Solve the problem using pandas.
- (B) Solve the problem using NumPy.
- (c) Solve the problem using pure Python.

Now, provide the answer using the method you picked.
