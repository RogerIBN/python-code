1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:02,00
So you're in high school physics class

2
00:00:02,00 --> 00:00:04,00
And your teacher asks the class

3
00:00:04,00 --> 00:00:07,00
Okay everyone what is the formula for

4
00:00:07,00 --> 00:00:08,00
Momentum

5
00:00:08,00 --> 00:00:10,00
And you being an eager young physics

6
00:00:10,00 --> 00:00:11,00
Student raise your hand

7
00:00:11,00 --> 00:00:13,00
And proudly tell your teacher that

8
00:00:13,00 --> 00:00:14,00
Momentum equals mass

9
00:00:14,00 --> 00:00:17,00
Times velocity and your teacher says

10
00:00:17,00 --> 00:00:18,00
Great job

11
00:00:18,00 --> 00:00:20,00
That is exactly right momentum equals

12
00:00:20,00 --> 00:00:21,00
Mass times velocity

13
00:00:21,00 --> 00:00:23,00
And the whole class claps and cheers for

14
00:00:23,00 --> 00:00:25,00
You because you got the answer right

15
00:00:25,00 --> 00:00:27,00
And you go up to the front of the class

16
00:00:27,00 --> 00:00:29,00
And your teacher gives you a gold star

17
00:00:29,00 --> 00:00:31,00
For being such a good physics student

18
00:00:31,00 --> 00:00:33,00
And that night you go home

19
00:00:33,00 --> 00:00:35,00
And your parents are there and they say

20
00:00:35,00 --> 00:00:36,00
We hear you got an answer right

21
00:00:36,00 --> 00:00:38,00
In physics class today and so we decided

22
00:00:38,00 --> 00:00:40,00
To celebrate your birthday

23
00:00:40,00 --> 00:00:42,00
Six months early and then they give you

24
00:00:42,00 --> 00:00:43,00
An xbox

25
00:00:43,00 --> 00:00:45,00
And so you stand proudly with your xbox

26
00:00:45,00 --> 00:00:46,00
In one hand

27
00:00:46,00 --> 00:00:48,00
And a copy of a brief history of time by

28
00:00:48,00 --> 00:00:50,00
Stephen hawking in the other

29
00:00:50,00 --> 00:00:51,00
And you tell yourself that this is the

30
00:00:51,00 --> 00:00:53,00
Best day of your life

31
00:00:53,00 --> 00:00:55,00
So you graduate high school with amazing

32
00:00:55,00 --> 00:00:57,00
Grades and then the day finally comes

33
00:00:57,00 --> 00:00:59,00
When you go to university to study

34
00:00:59,00 --> 00:01:00,00
Physics

35
00:01:00,00 --> 00:01:01,00
And you're really excited because you

36
00:01:01,00 --> 00:01:03,00
Are going to become a scientist

37
00:01:03,00 --> 00:01:05,00
You show up to your mechanics class and

38
00:01:05,00 --> 00:01:06,00
The professor asks

39
00:01:06,00 --> 00:01:09,00
What is the formula for momentum and you

40
00:01:09,00 --> 00:01:11,00
Tell your professor momentum equals mass

41
00:01:11,00 --> 00:01:12,00
Times velocity

42
00:01:12,00 --> 00:01:14,00
And then your professor gives you an

43
00:01:14,00 --> 00:01:15,00
Angry look and she says

44
00:01:15,00 --> 00:01:17,00
You complete idiot this isn't some

45
00:01:17,00 --> 00:01:19,00
Physics class for dumb babies

46
00:01:19,00 --> 00:01:21,00
We are studying rotational mechanics and

47
00:01:21,00 --> 00:01:23,00
In rotational mechanics an object's

48
00:01:23,00 --> 00:01:25,00
Momentum is defined using the inertia

49
00:01:25,00 --> 00:01:25,00
Tensor

50
00:01:25,00 --> 00:01:27,00
Which is a symmetric 3x3 matrix that you

51
00:01:27,00 --> 00:01:29,00
Can calculate by doing integrals over

52
00:01:29,00 --> 00:01:31,00
The mass distribution

53
00:01:31,00 --> 00:01:33,00
And the whole class of 300 people laugh

54
00:01:33,00 --> 00:01:35,00
At you for getting the answer wrong

55
00:01:35,00 --> 00:01:37,00
And for being a dumb idiot and you ask

56
00:01:37,00 --> 00:01:39,00
Yourself if you are really meant to be a

57
00:01:39,00 --> 00:01:40,00
Physics student after

58
00:01:40,00 --> 00:01:42,00
All maybe you are too much of a dumb

59
00:01:42,00 --> 00:01:43,00
Idiot to study physics

60
00:01:43,00 --> 00:01:45,00
You go home that night and desperately

61
00:01:45,00 --> 00:01:47,00
Search the internet to figure out what

62
00:01:47,00 --> 00:01:48,00
The inertia tensor is

63
00:01:48,00 --> 00:01:50,00
But you just get lost in a maze of

64
00:01:50,00 --> 00:01:51,00
Wikipedia articles and feel more

65
00:01:51,00 --> 00:01:54,00
Confused than when you started you

66
00:01:54,00 --> 00:01:55,00
Remember that day when your high school

67
00:01:55,00 --> 00:01:57,00
Teacher told you that you were right for

68
00:01:57,00 --> 00:01:58,00
Saying that momentum

69
00:01:58,00 --> 00:02:00,00
Equals mass times velocity and you

70
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:01,00
Wonder why your high school physics

71
00:02:01,00 --> 00:02:02,00
Teacher lied to you

72
00:02:02,00 --> 00:02:04,00
And why they didn't tell you about the

73
00:02:04,00 --> 00:02:06,00
Inertia tensor the next day you show up

74
00:02:06,00 --> 00:02:08,00
At your relativity class

75
00:02:08,00 --> 00:02:10,00
And your professor is albert einstein

76
00:02:10,00 --> 00:02:12,00
And einstein tells you that momentum is

77
00:02:12,00 --> 00:02:14,00
A four-dimensional vector that lives in

78
00:02:14,00 --> 00:02:15,00
Four-dimensional space-time

79
00:02:15,00 --> 00:02:17,00
And you tell einstein that you thought

80
00:02:17,00 --> 00:02:18,00
Momentum was calculated with the

81
00:02:18,00 --> 00:02:21,00
Three-by-three symmetric inertia tensor

82
00:02:21,00 --> 00:02:23,00
And einstein is like well technically

83
00:02:23,00 --> 00:02:25,00
Rotational angular momentum is a

84
00:02:25,00 --> 00:02:27,00
Four-dimensional bivector but that's

85
00:02:27,00 --> 00:02:29,00
Outside the scope of this course

86
00:02:29,00 --> 00:02:31,00
Later you go to your advanced mechanics

87
00:02:31,00 --> 00:02:32,00
Class and your professor tells you that

88
00:02:32,00 --> 00:02:34,00
Generalized momentum

89
00:02:34,00 --> 00:02:36,00
Conjugate to position is defined as the

90
00:02:36,00 --> 00:02:38,00
Partial derivative of the lagrangian

91
00:02:38,00 --> 00:02:39,00
With respect to q

92
00:02:39,00 --> 00:02:41,00
Dot and in hamiltonian mechanics

93
00:02:41,00 --> 00:02:42,00
Momentum is just a coordinate in the

94
00:02:42,00 --> 00:02:43,00
Phase space

95
00:02:43,00 --> 00:02:45,00
On a symplectic manifold and then you go

96
00:02:45,00 --> 00:02:47,00
To your quantum physics class and the

97
00:02:47,00 --> 00:02:48,00
Professor says that momentum

98
00:02:48,00 --> 00:02:50,00
Measurements are always probabilistic

99
00:02:50,00 --> 00:02:52,00
And the way to get the expected value of

100
00:02:52,00 --> 00:02:53,00
Momentum is to operate on the

101
00:02:53,00 --> 00:02:55,00
Wavefunction with the momentum operator

102
00:02:55,00 --> 00:02:57,00
Which has the square root of negative 1

103
00:02:57,00 --> 00:02:58,00
In it for some reason

104
00:02:58,00 --> 00:03:00,00
And then do an integral over all

105
00:03:00,00 --> 00:03:02,00
Possible outcomes and also the momentum

106
00:03:02,00 --> 00:03:04,00
Wave function might be the fourier

107
00:03:04,00 --> 00:03:05,00
Transform of the position wave function

108
00:03:05,00 --> 00:03:07,00
But he can't be sure since everything is

109
00:03:07,00 --> 00:03:09,00
Just probabilities

110
00:03:09,00 --> 00:03:10,00
At this point you've completely given up

111
00:03:10,00 --> 00:03:12,00
Trying to understand what momentum is

112
00:03:12,00 --> 00:03:14,00
You've stopped going to classes and

113
00:03:14,00 --> 00:03:15,00
You've stopped doing your homework

114
00:03:15,00 --> 00:03:17,00
Because life is pointless and physics

115
00:03:17,00 --> 00:03:18,00
Will never

116
00:03:18,00 --> 00:03:20,00
Make sense no matter how hard you try

117
00:03:20,00 --> 00:03:22,00
You remember back to the greatest day of

118
00:03:22,00 --> 00:03:23,00
Your life when your high school physics

119
00:03:23,00 --> 00:03:25,00
Teacher gave you a gold star

120
00:03:25,00 --> 00:03:27,00
And you remember now that your teacher

121
00:03:27,00 --> 00:03:29,00
Had this tired look in her eye

122
00:03:29,00 --> 00:03:31,00
A quiet sadness that you couldn't

123
00:03:31,00 --> 00:03:33,00
Explain and that's when you realize

124
00:03:33,00 --> 00:03:35,00
She knew she knew that momentum wasn't

125
00:03:35,00 --> 00:03:37,00
Equal to mass times velocity

126
00:03:37,00 --> 00:03:38,00
Because she had gone to university to

127
00:03:38,00 --> 00:03:40,00
Study physics just like you

128
00:03:40,00 --> 00:03:42,00
And she lied to you to protect you from

129
00:03:42,00 --> 00:03:43,00
The truth

130
00:03:43,00 --> 00:03:45,00
Because she didn't want you to deal with

131
00:03:45,00 --> 00:03:46,00
The pain of never knowing what momentum

132
00:03:46,00 --> 00:03:48,00
Is because it's too complicated

133
00:03:48,00 --> 00:03:50,00
And you realize that students all over

134
00:03:50,00 --> 00:03:52,00
The world are in high school right now

135
00:03:52,00 --> 00:03:54,00
Being lied to being told that momentum

136
00:03:54,00 --> 00:03:56,00
Is mass times velocity

137
00:03:56,00 --> 00:03:58,00
And they too will go to university and

138
00:03:58,00 --> 00:04:00,00
Learn the truth and suffer just like you

139
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:00,00
Did

140
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:03,00
And you clench your fists in anger you

141
00:04:03,00 --> 00:04:05,00
Realize that the eternal cycle of folly

142
00:04:05,00 --> 00:04:06,00
Needs to be stopped and it's time to

143
00:04:06,00 --> 00:04:09,00
Destroy momentum once and for all

144
00:04:09,00 --> 00:04:11,00
So you go to switzerland and dig a

145
00:04:11,00 --> 00:04:13,00
Tunnel to the large hadron collider

146
00:04:13,00 --> 00:04:14,00
And you're about to push the secret

147
00:04:14,00 --> 00:04:16,00
Button on the large hadron collider that

148
00:04:16,00 --> 00:04:18,00
Will destroy the universe

149
00:04:18,00 --> 00:04:19,00
But then the avengers show up to stop

150
00:04:19,00 --> 00:04:22,00
You and captain america tells you that

151
00:04:22,00 --> 00:04:23,00
He understands how you feel

152
00:04:23,00 --> 00:04:25,00
And that we've all been there we've all

153
00:04:25,00 --> 00:04:27,00
Been confused in physics class

154
00:04:27,00 --> 00:04:29,00
And think that we're dumb but the way to

155
00:04:29,00 --> 00:04:31,00
Deal with pain isn't to destroy the

156
00:04:31,00 --> 00:04:31,00
Universe

157
00:04:31,00 --> 00:04:33,00
Instead we should help others and use

158
00:04:33,00 --> 00:04:35,00
Our life experience to make the world

159
00:04:35,00 --> 00:04:36,00
Less painful

160
00:04:36,00 --> 00:04:38,00
For future generations and iron man says

161
00:04:38,00 --> 00:04:39,00
He wants

162
00:04:39,00 --> 00:04:41,00
Shawarma anyway the avengers beat you up

163
00:04:41,00 --> 00:04:43,00
And the police arrest you and when

164
00:04:43,00 --> 00:04:45,00
You're in court the judge sentences you

165
00:04:45,00 --> 00:04:47,00
To life in prison for trying to destroy

166
00:04:47,00 --> 00:04:49,00
The universe which is the worst possible

167
00:04:49,00 --> 00:04:49,00
Crime

168
00:04:49,00 --> 00:04:51,00
So you're sentenced to life in a

169
00:04:51,00 --> 00:04:52,00
Frictionless vacuum

170
00:04:52,00 --> 00:04:54,00
Eternally bouncing off the walls of your

171
00:04:54,00 --> 00:04:57,00
Cell in perfectly elastic collisions

172
00:04:57,00 --> 00:04:58,00
And all you can think about is whether

173
00:04:58,00 --> 00:05:00,00
You should calculate your momentum with

174
00:05:00,00 --> 00:05:02,00
An inertia tensor or a lagrangian or a

175
00:05:02,00 --> 00:05:03,00
Wave function

176
00:05:03,00 --> 00:05:11,00
And you will never know the answer

177
00:05:11,00 --> 00:05:14,00
Happy april fools normally i use this

178
00:05:14,00 --> 00:05:16,00
